  <p class="text-justify">Lego Computer can be used in the <span class="mat-body-strong">Multi-station</span> system. The system enables the use of a <span class="mat-body-strong">workstation as a central unit</span>. You can create up <span class="mat-body-strong">to 6 positions</span> in your home. Separate stations allow you to use the central unit in the best possible way. Users can work, watch movies, play games, browse the internet at one time in different rooms without any compromise. <span class="mat-body-strong">An efficient central unit</span> can cope with the most demanding tasks. The system can be implemented as early as at the construction design stage of an apartment or house (non ho capito questa frase). You only need to choose the location of the central unit and the number of positions in the system. Proper operation of the <span class="mat-body-strong">Multi-station</span> system requires appropriate HDMI cabling (image, sound) USB (keyboard, mouse, USB flash drive, printer, DVD-ROM, external drive, phone, USB hub in the monitor, etc.).</p>
